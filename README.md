# burger-homework12
In this homework I utilized mySql as a database to hold information about burgers that are created; the names and whether or not they are eaten.
The user has the ability to create a new burger in the input field which gets thrown into the table on mySql and displayed on the screen utilizing an Ajax Post command.  
NPMs used include: mySql, Express, and Express-handlebars.
